#Compilation issue

#Lombok issue


#First close the STS.

#Copy lombok-x.xx.xx.jar from ~/.m2 repository. (E.g. ~\.m2\repository\org\projectlombok\lombok\1.16.14\lombok-1.16.14.jar)

#Rename the copied jar to lombok.jar and paste it in STS home directory right beside STS launcher exe (E.g. D:\spring-tool-suite-3.9.0.RELEASE-e4.7.0-win32-x86_64\sts-bundle\sts-3.9.0.RELEASE\)

#Open STS.ini (Name of this file can be different based on the STS version) and write -javaagent:lombok.jar line in the end .

#Restart STS

#Go to help>About Spring Tool Suit and check. You will see a message like "Lombok v1.16.14 "Candid Duck" is installed. https://projectlombok.org/"

#For any existing project error, RCL on the project, Go to Maven>Update Project.
